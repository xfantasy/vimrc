==============================================================================
1. Overview~ 						*txt-introduction*

The "Plain Text Browser" plugin is a plain text browser plugin for Vim. This
plugin allows you to efficiently browse through plain text files. The "Plain
Text Browser" plugin provides the following features:

    * Displays the tags (titles, figures, tables, etc.) defined in a file in a
      vertically or horizontally split Vim window.
    * Groups the tags by their type and displays them in a foldable tree.
    * Hightlight the key elements of a plain text, such elements include:
      keywords(such TODO, ERROR,etc), URLs, texts in bracket, etc.
    * When a tag of title or figure name is selected from the taglist window,
      positions the cursor at the begin of the title or gifure definitions.
    * The list of tags can be saved and then copied to write the content list.
    * Automatically highlights the current tag name.
    * The elemnet of the plain text can be modified easily.
    * Runs in both console/terminal and GUI versions of Vim
    * Can be used in both Unix and MS-Windows systems.
    * Other features in "taglist" plugin.

This file is itself a plain text, and if you have install the "Plain Text
Browser" plugin alreadly, You might already get the syntax highlight which
would make key element hightlight and easy to read. Use ":Tlist" command to
open the text taglist window to have a outline of the fil. Even you have not
install the "Plain Text Browser" plugin, you can this files in any text editor
and web browser, but without syntax hightlight and outline.

==============================================================================
2. Installation~ 					*txt-install*

1) Please make sure taglist(vimscript #273: taglist.vim) has been installed.

2) Download the txt.zip file and unzip the files to the $HOME/.vim or the
$HOME/vimfiles or the $VIM/vimfiles directory, Then cut the file ".ctags" to
your $HOME/ directory. After this step, you should have the following four
files (the directory structure should be preserved):

	* $HOME/.vim/syntax/txt.vim - syntax for text/plain.
	* $HOME/.vim/plugin/txtbrowser.vim - browser tools.
	* $HOME/.vim/doc/txtbrowser.txt - help document in English.
	* $HOME/.vim/doc/txtbrowser.cnx - help document in Chinese. (Open the
					file and Use ":helptags ." to install)
	* $HOME/.ctags - language definition of Exuberant Ctags for txt.

Because release before 1.1.1 use the old plugin name, please delete the old
release at first.(mainly the help documents: txt.txt and txt_cn.txt).


3) Add the following line into your .vimrc file and restart your vim.

	syntax on "syntax highlighting on
	let tlist_txt_settings = 'txt;c:content;f:figures;t:tables'
	au BufRead,BufNewFile *.txt setlocal ft=txt

"TxtBorwser" collaborate well with almost all the plugins(NERD_Tree, txtfmt,
etc), If you want to combine this plugin with other text plugin(take vimscript
#2208: txtfmt as example), You could simply added the following 2 autocommands
to your .vimrc after the line `setlocal ft=txt' as described above:

	au BufRead,BufNewFile *.txt runtime ftplugin/txtfmt.vim
	au BufRead,BufNewFile *.txt runtime syntax/txtfmt.vim 

To uninstall the taglist plugin, remove the plugin/taglist.vim and
doc/taglist.txt files from the $HOME/.vim or $HOME/vimfiles directory.

==============================================================================
3. features and howto use

After the install and preview, you must have a perceptual concept about the
"TxtBrowser" plugin. I will intruduce the detail about how to use these
features in this chapter.

3.1 syntax hightlight					*txt-highlight*

The feature of syntax hightlight make you document highlight the key part,
which include the title, keywords, list, etc. This features is loaded
automatically whenever you open your .txt document. It is recommented that try
other colorscheme to find the best display of your document.

Some documents that don't have the extension "txt" are indeed plain text
documents. You could view these document with syntax highlight. How to do it?
After open these documents, use the command ":set ft=txt" to explicitly tell
the Vim to highlight.

For example, I often view the .log files, I could view the highlight after the
above setting. But it seems that it is a common file type I need to view, so I
add the following line to my .vimrc file to automatically add the syntax
hightlight:

	au BufRead,BufNewFile *.log setlocal ft=txt

3.2 Browser the title				 *txt-browser-title*

If your are a programmer, you must have used the "taglist" plugin to browser
your code. Think about use the same method to browser plain text files. The
"TxtBrowser" plugin make it possible to browser plain text files as browser C
programme. Use ":Tlist" command to open the taglist window, Your title will be
listed in the window. Just by clicking the tag, you would jump where the title
is. This is the same as jumping to where the figures and tables are defined.

Suppose you want to add the table of content to you file after you finish edit.
It's easy with the "TxtBrowser" plugin. Just copying the table of content from
the taglist window and paste it to where you want to put.

How vim know whick is title and which is the table? Let's read the RFC documnet
and find something.

In general, RFC documents have a cover, and the table of content, and then the
main body. We don't care abuot these. What we care is how the titles are
defined. Aha, We found the titles start with a digit, and a symbol "." and then
the name. That comply to people's habit. So we define titles as above. Please
see Chapter4 "Element Definition" for details of how these are defined.

In the meantime, it's highly recommended to use the formal title format.

3.3 Browser the tables and figures			*txt-browser-table*

Some documents have a plenty of tables and figures. It might difficult to
locate them. But with "TxtBrowser" plugin you could rapidly locate them just by
clicking the tag. The method of use is the same as Chapter 3.2 "Browser the
title".

3.4 Browser the URL in the files			*txt-browser-url*

Sometimes we want browser the url in the files. Do you need to open a web
browser and type the address? It's not required. After release 1.1.1, just
putting the cursor to the url and use command ":TxtBrowserUrl" to open the url.
Alternatively you could use map "<Leader>g" to open the url. Here is <Leader>
is the key of your "mapleader" value. If you didn't define that value, it is
"\" key in the keyboard. That means, you type the "\" and "g" would open your
url.

3.5 Lookup the dictionary				*txt-browser-dict*

Sometimes you might need to lookup the dictionary. "TxtBrowser" provide a means
to lookup the words in dictionary web page. How to use? Just put your cursor to
the word and use command ":TxtBrowserWord". Alternatively you could use map
"<Leader>f". 

I set the google English/Chinese dictionary to the defaut dictionayr web page.
It's easy to set your own prefered dictionary. Open your prefered dictionary
web page and lookup the word "text" and got the url link. Copy this link(don't
change any chars) to the following variable in your .vimrc, For example, the
url we got when looking up the word "text" is "http://dict.cn/text", I set my
prefered dictionay page as below in my .vimrc file:

|In my ".vimrc"
|
|let TxtBrowser_Dict_Url='http://dict.cn/text'

3.6 Search Word	in the internet				*txt-browser-search*

Sometimes you might search a hot word in your document by some search engine,
such as Google. "TxtBrowser" provide a new feature to open the search result
just by a command ":TxtBrowserSearch" or the following map:

	<Leader>s

The defaut search engine is www.google.com(It's google Chinese, Different
country and diffrent district may differ from each other), You can custimize
you prefered search engine. It's the same as set your prefered web word
dictionayr. Open your prefered Search engine(for example www.baidu.com),  and
search a word "text", for exampe we get the link:
"http://www.baidu.com/s?wd=text&oq=text&f=3&rsp=2",I set my prefered search
engine as below in my .vimrc file:

In my ".vimrc"
|
|let Txtbrowser_Search_Engine='http://www.baidu.com/s?wd=text&oq=text&f=3&rsp=2'

3.7 Other features				*txt-browser-others*

New features(for example offline words lookup, selected word lookup, etc) are
to be released in the following release. Please Pay attention to it:

	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2899

You are welcome to report bugs and raise your suggestion and supply means to
implement those features. Thank you very much.

4. Element Definition                              		*txt-element*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 Text title                                  		*txt-title*

We recognize the title according to the serial numbers. For example: 1，1.1，
1.1.1, Please note that the numbers should at the begin of the line and there
should be some space between the numbers and the chapter name. The number of
the symbol "." decide the level of the title. For example:

--regex-txt=/^([0-9]+\.?[ \t]+)([^,]+$)/\1\2/c,content/
--regex-txt=/^(([0-9]+\.){1}([0-9]+\.?)[ \t]+)([^,]+$)/.   \1\4/c,content/
--regex-txt=/^(([0-9]+\.){2}([0-9]+\.?)[ \t]+)([^,]+$)/.       \1\4/c,content/

1000001. This is a test of title level 1
~no sp, ~~~~~sp here

This is an example of title level 1. Please note that there is no space at the
begin of the line and spaces betwenn the numbers and title name.

1000001.1 This is a test of title level 2

content of title level 2.

1000001.1.1 This is a test of title level 3

content of title level 3.

Tags windows only support three levels title, but hightlight has no limit of
this. This is the definition of text title in tag windows:

--regex-txt=/^([0-9]+\.?[ \t]+)([^,]+$)/\1\2/c,content/
--regex-txt=/^(([0-9]+\.){1}([0-9]+\.?)[ \t]+)([^,]+$)/.   \1\4/c,content/
--regex-txt=/^(([0-9]+\.){2}([0-9]+\.?)[ \t]+)([^,]+$)/.       \1\4/c,content/

And this is the definition for highlight. Please here we use the vim special
regular expression(use ":help regex" for more detail).

syn match txtTitle "^\(\d\+\.\)\+\s*[^,。，]\+$"
syn match txtTitle "^\([一二三四五六七八九十][、.]\)\+\s*[^,。，]\+$"

6. Fequently Answered questions~				 *txt-faqs*

6.1 Error reported when open Tlist

Question: Unknown language "txt" in "language-force" option, This is the error
info:

    Taglist: Failed to generate tags for d:\BAK\aaa.txt
    ^@d:\BAK>d:\Tools\Editors\gVim\Utility\ctags\ctags.exe -f - --format=2
    --excmd=pattern --fields=nks --sort=yes --language-force=txt
    --txt-types=cft "d:\BAK\aaa.txt" ^@ctags.exe: Unknown language "txt" in
    "language-force" option 

Answered:

It seemed that you put the file .ctags to a wrong location. The .ctags should
be on $HOME directory. It is easy to find your $HOME directory on Linux, but it
may be confusing to those using Windows. Generally, your $HOME directory should
be "C:\Documents and Settings\abcd" if you login name is "abcd". Open
"Start-Run-Cmd" and use "cd " (with no parameters) command to goto your $HOME
directory. 

6.2 couldn't deal well with files which path contain Chinese character

Question: On Windows(cygwin and linux works well), If the filename or directory
name has CJK(Chinese tested only) chars, the taglist couldn't be shown.
   
Answer: Solution 1. You could download the modified taglist.vim I provided to
fix this problem. Alternatively, You could also patch the diff in the netx
paragraph. This is the link to down the modified taglist.vim:

	http://att.newsmth.net/att.php?p.731.54466.3068.vim

Let me analysis the root cause of the issue:

1) When upgrade from version 4.1 to 4.2, taglist add a logic: Windows pass the
command to a temporary file insteading of to the cmd directly. That cause the
issue and it would work well after deleting it. I didn't understand it and I
didn't meet error after deleting it.

2) If you use enc=utf8 as your default encoding, Windows wouldn't recognize the
parameters because it only accepts cp936. So we must use function iconv() to
convert the encoding from utf8 to cp936 beforce pass the command to the cmd.

Because taglist pass the enc value not the fenc value to the operating system,
So the title tag wouldn't be listed correctly if they are different. So please
make sure your file have the same enc and fenc, or the title tags wouldn't be
listed correctly. I would study this issue if I have time in the following
days. Please be patient. Any collaboration, suggestion and help is welcome.

This is the alternative way to fix this issue: patch the following diff(based
on taglist.vim v4.5):

6.3 Taglist not updated after the file changed.

Question: When I change my file, The taglist is not updated.

Answer: You should call ":TlistUpdate" command manually to update your taglist
after you change you file. It is recommended to map this command as below:

	nmap <silent> <F5> <ESC>:TlistUpdate<RETURN>

6.4 taglist list Chinese characters as <b1><b0>...

Question: The taglist couldn't list Chinese chars now, they are shown as
<b1><b0>...

Answer: Sometime when the enc and fenc of the file are different, The taglist
might not be shown correctly. To solve the problems, please make sure they are
the same. 

6.5 taglist show every title 2 times.

问: The taglist list my title 2 times as below, why?

	1. xxxxxxxx
	1. xxxxxxxx
	2. cccccccc
	2. cccccccc
	...
	...

every congiguration in the following position and it will read twice if there
are duplicate configuration in the following locations, Please delete the other
configuration file.

	/ctags.cnf (on MSDOS, MSWindows only)
	/etc/ctags.conf

6.6 taglist show title in wrong order:

Question: When I open the taglist, there are something like title, but it is
confusing:

	txtbrowser_cnx.txt (D:\release\1.1.6\doc)
	  content
	    .       1000001.1.1 标题1.1.1
	    .   1000001.1 标题1.1
	    .   2.1 安装插件
	    .   2.2 卸载
	    .   2.3 可能会遇到的问题
	    .   2.4 安装可选项
	    .   3.1 语法高亮功能

Answer: The title are shown correctly but the order is wrong, put the curser to
the taglist window and use 's' command to reorder it by alphabetical  order.
You mush have the following configuration in your .vimrc:

	let Tlist_Sort_Type = "name"

Please delete the above or change it as following:

	au BufRead,BufNewFile *.txt let Tlist_Sort_Type = "order"
